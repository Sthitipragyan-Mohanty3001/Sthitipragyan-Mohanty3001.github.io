    <div>
        <div id="abtme"><pre> My name is Sthitipragyan Mohanty. I am 
 20 years old. I am from Keonjhar, Odisha. I 
 completed my matriculation from Nirmala Convent
 School, Keonjhar and my intermediate from Kendriya
 Vidyalaya, Keonjhar. Currently, I am pursuing my 
 Bachelor of Technology degree from Veer Surendra Sai 
 University of Technology, Burla from the department 
 Computer Science and Engineering. My hobbies are 
 painting, sketching and listening to music. My aim is 
 to become a data scientist.

    <div id="interest-qual">
        <div id="interests"><pre> My Interests mostly lie in coding and painting. I 
 found out about coding during my eighth grade when
 java was introduced in our syllabus. From the 
 beginning itself I started to ace in it in our class.
 Maybe that was the reason why I gained the confidence 
 to consider Computer Science as my core subject. 
 Coding was a bit complicated at the beginning but once
 I got the hang of it, nothing seemed more amusing 
 than that. So choosing a career path in which I could
 do something enjoyable was the best decision of my 
 life. I know that the life of a Software Engineer is 
 really hectic but I still wanna see where I am gonna 
 end up in the future. Now talking about painting, it 
 is something that I loved way earlier than coding. If 
 I remember it correctly, it was during my second grade 
 that I first joined an ART class and continued that  
 for nine whole years. Painting and drawing were like 
 my safe place. Maybe now also they are the same. Apart 
 from these two, I also love listening to kpop songs. 
 At first, I did not even know what it was but once I 
 got into it, it was impossible to go back.</pre></div>
